# 6GAMER PRO - TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

## 📚 Project Overview
6GAMER is a high-performance, fullstack gaming platform designed with a premium "Royal Gold" aesthetic. It features 7 core games with real-time global leaderboards, achievement systems, and an advanced admin dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.5 (App Router), React 19, Framer Motion (Animations), Tailwind CSS 4.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for real-time data, Auth for security, Storage for assets).
- **Database Logic**: Drizzle ORM for local data management.
- **Icons & UI**: Lucide React, Shadcn/UI patterns.
- **Communication**: Nodemailer for OTP/Email services.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/app/`: Contains all page routes (Home, Games, Leadership, Login, Admin).
- `src/components/games/`: Core logic for every game (BallMaze, Ludo, Snake, etc.).
- `src/app/api/`: Backend API routes for stats, leaderboards, and user management.
- `src/lib/`: Firebase configuration and shared utility hooks.

## 🕹️ Game Logic Breakdown

### 1. Ludo King (Royal Edition)
- **Logic**: Implements full Ludo board rules (15x15 grid).
- **AI System**: A priority-based scoring algorithm (`calculateBestMove`):
  - **Tier 1 (1,000,000 pts)**: Move that reaches HOME.
  - **Tier 2 (500,000 pts)**: Move that hits/captures an opponent's piece.
  - **Tier 3 (300,000 pts)**: Deploying a new piece from the base.
  - **Tier 4 (100,000 pts)**: Landing on a "Safe Spot" (Star).
- **Mechanics**: Space/Enter to roll, 1-4 keys to select pieces.

### 2. Ball Maze (Precision Movement)
- **Logic**: Canvas-based rendering with grid collision.
- **Features**: 
  - **Fog of War**: A radial gradient hides parts of the maze.
  - **Magnet Power-up**: Uses distance-based attraction to pull coins toward the player.
  - **Moving Walls**: Level 5+ introduces dynamic obstacles that bounce between walls.
- **Infinite Play**: Levels advance indefinitely; time is unlimited.

### 3. Bird Fly (Physics-based)
- **Logic**: Simple gravity and velocity simulation (`requestAnimationFrame`).
- **Mechanics**: Tap/Space to apply upward force. Score increases as you pass through golden pillars.

### 4. Ghost Kill (Reflex)
- **Logic**: Time-based spawning. Ghosts appear at random coordinates; users must click/hover to "slay" them before they vanish.

## 🎨 UI/UX Features
- **Animations**: Uses `framer-motion` for scroll-reveal sections, 3D game card rotations, and smooth page transitions.
- **Theme**: Custom CSS variables for `gold-gradient` and `galaxy-bg` provide a royal feel.
- **Performance**: Heavy use of `memo`, `useCallback`, and `useRef` to ensure 60 FPS gameplay.

## 🔐 Auth & Security
- **Firebase Auth**: Secure login/signup with session persistence.
- **Admin Mode**: Special access for `admin@6gamer.com` to test games even when "Coming Soon" or disabled.
- **OTP Verification**: Email-based verification for password resets.

## 📊 Database & Stats
- **Firestore**: Stores live high scores and user profiles.
  - **Leadership**: Real-time aggregation of the top 100 players globally with auto-sliding scoring view (5s interval).
  - **Achievements**: Automated triggers when users reach milestones (e.g., "100 Wins", "Speed Demon").
  - **Project Report**: Comprehensive BCA Minor Project Report generated (`MINOR_PROJECT_REPORT.md`).
