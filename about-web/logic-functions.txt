6gamer Game Logic and Functions (Technical Breakdown)

This file contains the core logic and functions used in 6gamer games.

1. Ball Maze Logic (BallMaze.tsx):
- Function handleKeyDown: Updates player coordinates (pos.x, pos.y) based on Arrow Keys.
- Grid Logic: Uses cellSize (40px) to move precisely.
- Wall Check: Uses walls.some() to prevent moving into gold blocks.
- Win Check: If player reaches (mazeSize - cellSize, mazeSize - cellSize), level completes.
- Rendering: Canvas draws walls, player, and exit on every frame update.

2. Ghost Kill Logic (GhostKill.tsx):
- spawnGhost: Uses useCallback and setInterval to spawn a ghost at random X/Y (10-90%).
- killGhost: Triggered on onClick. Increases count and plays sound.
- Difficulty: Ghost disappearance time decreases with level (2000 - level * 100).
- Level Complete: Target count (10 + level * 2) must be reached.

3. Bird Fly Logic (BirdFly.tsx):
- jump(): Decreases birdY (prev - 60) to simulate flight.
- Gravity Interval: Increases birdY (prev + 3) every 30ms.
- Pipe Movement: Pipes move left (x - 3 + level*0.5).
- Collision: Checks if birdY is outside the pipe gap or hits the ground.
- Level up: Based on pipes passed successfully.

4. Snake Pro Logic (SnakeGame.tsx):
- moveSnake: Calculates new head position based on current direction.
- Food Logic: If head hits food, snake length increases, and food respawns.
- Collision: Self-collision checked via snake.some(). Wall collision checked via grid bounds.

5. Typing Master Logic (TypingMaster.tsx):
- Vanishing Logic: Opacity decreases by (0.01 + level * 0.005) every 50ms.
- handleInput: Validates user input (case-insensitive). If match, next word spawns.
- Game Over: Triggered if opacity reaches 0.

6. Word Maker Logic (WordMaker.tsx):
- Scramble: word.split('').sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5).
- Selection: Players click buttons to build a word string.
- Validation: If final string matches original word, points are awarded.

Common Functions:
- handleLevelComplete: Increments score, level, and triggers confetti.
- handleGameOver: Saves final score to Firebase 'leaderboard' collection.
- RootProvider: Handles global loading state and gold-themed transitions.
- Navbar/Footer: Provides royal navigation across all full-stack routes.
