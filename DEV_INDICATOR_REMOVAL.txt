Steps to remove Next.js Dev Indicators (The "N" badge, static route indicator, and dev overlay):

1.  **Modify next.config.ts**:
    Add the following configuration to your `nextConfig` object:
    ```typescript
    devIndicators: {
      appIsrStatus: false,
      buildActivity: false,
    },
    experimental: {
      devIndicator: false
    }
    ```
    This disables the build activity spinner and the static/dynamic route indicators in the bottom corner.

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    In some environments, Next.js adds debugging tools. Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` when deploying. Next.js naturally hides these indicators in production builds (`next build && next start`).

3.  **Browser Extensions**:
    If you see a Next.js icon in your browser's address bar or dev tools, that is likely the "Next.js DevTools" browser extension, which can be disabled in your browser settings.

4.  **Error Overlays**:
    While you cannot completely disable the development error overlay (as it's critical for debugging), it will never appear in the production environment.

5.  **Turbopack Specifics**:
    When using `--turbopack`, some UI elements are handled by the Turbopack dev server. These are also development-only and will not persist in a production build.
